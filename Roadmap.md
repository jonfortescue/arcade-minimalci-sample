This repository will serve as an example for all who wish to migrate to VSTS for their builds. Therefore, we want it to provide clear examples of common use cases.

## Short Term
In the short term, we want to immediately fill the needs of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr). This means that we will have a `.vsts-ci.yml` file which does the following:

* Examples of plug & play telemetry
* Integration with and configuration of Maestro
* Consumption of Darc
